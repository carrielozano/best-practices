###Collective Work: Best Practices for Collaborative Investigative Reporting (EN)

#### 1. Consider the following when planning investigative collaborations:

- What is the scope of the collaboration?
- What are the anticipated contributions of each organization?
- What is the plan for working together throughout the process?
- How do collaborators prefer to communicate?
- How will the project be managed?
- How will information and findings be shared?
- How will content be shared?
- What are the anticipated obstacles? And how might they be resolved?
- How will the editorial, fact-checking, legal review and publication processes work?
- How will the consistency of information and key facts be insured?
- How will the collaboration be branded and publicized?
- Who will follow up on breaking news related to the story, post-publication?
- How will the project be submitted and credited for awards?
- How will revenues (if you’re lucky enough to have any) be shared?

#### 2. Put agreements in writing, including:

- The goal(s) of the partnership.
- The reporting/publication plan.
- Assigned tasks and deadlines.
- Agreements about resources.
- Agreements reached throughout the process.

#### 3. Assign a project manager, distinct from an editor, who manages the
organizational aspects of the collaboration. This manager sets up a group
email, arranges meetings and agendas, tracks the activities of each
organization and stays on top of tasks.

#### 4. Determine a process for sharing information: sources, documents, data.

#### 5. Discuss how you will work with sources:

- How will you keep track of who has talked to whom?
- How will you represent the project and the news organizations involved?
- Who is the primary contact for each source?
- How will you coordinate interviews?
- How will you handle off-the-record sources and information?

#### 6. Understand the mediums that your partners are working in and what they
require to produce their story.

#### 7. Understand your partners’ organizational culture, structure and publishing
requirements/limitations.

#### 8. Focus on teambuilding and fostering communication and leadership skills
within your organization.
